# Mini Rails
A from-scratch rebuild of the `rails` gem. Includes working versions of:

- Action Controller
- Action View
- Action Dispatch
- Active Record
- Active Support
- And more

Tests are using `rspec`. Run `rake` to invoke the test suite.

## Thanks

This gem is based on the course [_Owning Rails_](http://owningrails.com) by
Marc-Andr√© Cournoyer.
